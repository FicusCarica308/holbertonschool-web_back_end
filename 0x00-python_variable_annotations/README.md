![Holberton Logo](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.holbertonschool.com%2Fholberton-logo-simple.png&f=1&nofb=1)


## Learning objectives: 
### Advanced python concepts:

* Type annotations in Python 3
* How you can use type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types
* Duck typing
* How to validate your code with mypy

## Tasks:

* 0-add.py -  type-annotated function add that takes a float a and a float b as arguments and returns their sum as a float
* 1-concat.py - type-annotated function concat that takes a string str1 and a string str2 as arguments and returns a concatenated string
* 2-floor.py -  a type-annotated function floor which takes a float n as argument and returns the floor of the float
* 3-tor_str.py -  a type-annotated function to_str that takes a float n as argument and returns the string representation of the float
* 4-define_variables.py - Defines and annotates four variables
* 5-sum_list.py - a type-annotated function sum_list which takes a list input_list of floats as argument and returns their sum as a float
* 6-sum_mixed_list.py - a type-annotated function sum_mixed_list which takes a list mxd_lst of integers and floats and returns their sum as a float
* 7-to_kv.py - a type-annotated function to_kv that takes a string k and an int OR float v as arguments and returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the string k. The second element is the square of the int/float v and should be annotated as a float
* 8-make_multiplier.py -  a type-annotated function make_multiplier that takes a float multiplier as argument and returns a function that multiplies a float by multiplier
* 9-element_length.py - practice annotation with given function
